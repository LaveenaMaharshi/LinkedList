// create two queues using built in class queues
// define constructor where queues will be implemented using linkedlist
// create method push where we need to push the element in the linkedlist ,no
// change in logic as queues will also push elements from the top
// create method pop where the deletion need to be from the end ,so implement a
// loop till we are left with last element and remove the elements from first
// queue and push them on second queue,
// after that remove the last element from first queue
// push all the elements back to queue1.
// create a method top()which will return the element on the top (last element)
